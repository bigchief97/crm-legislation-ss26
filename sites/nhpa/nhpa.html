          <p style="text-align: left;">
            On October 15, 1966, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Enabled by the United States’ booming post-World War II economy, development projects were occurring all over the country. Many of these were massively destructive, leading to the demolition of urban neighborhoods and natural landscapes alike (NPS 2023a). As ever-increasing amounts of historically significant sites were razed, citizens became progressively more concerned about losses of heritage and knowledge. Their concerns were validated by early preservation programs like the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) which documented historic buildings but was powerless to save them (NPS 2023b). As a result of these growing anxieties, President Johnson formed a committee focused on historical preservation, which soon proposed the National Historic Preservation Act.

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            With the passage of the NHPA, the United States of America created a mandate for a national preservation program alongside a system of protections that encourage the identification and protection of historic resources (National Park Service 2025). The NHPA does this through several mechanisms. First, it created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) which serves as the official federal inventory for locations of historical, architectural, archaeological, cultural, and engineering significance. Secondly, the passage of the NHPA created Section 106 and Section 110. Section 106 (named after its location in the NHPA) is a review process for projects conducted by federal agencies (or any project receiving federal funding) that requires the consideration of the effects of federally licensed, assisted, regulated, or funded activities on the properties listed in the NRHP or locations that are eligible for NRHP listing. Section 110 mandates that all federal agencies (in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior) establish their own historic preservation programs for the identification, evaluation, and protection of historic properties. Third, the National Historic Preservation Act established a grant program that is supported by the Historic Preservation Fund. Finally, the NHPA created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which is an independent agency that advises the President and Congress on preservation matters, along with federal agencies on their role in the national historic preservation program (NPS 2025). While amendments have been made to the Act (with the most recent occurring in 2014 with Public Law 13-287 [NPS 2025]), the goal of preserving historic locations has remained the same since its inception.

          <p>While writing your document, you will probably have to go back and forth between editing your document, and viewing your document in a web browser. This will allow you to instantly see how the design of your web page is going. 80% of the work for this project will probably be spent on coming up with the content, and finding appropriate images for arguments. Another 10% will likely go into putting that content into your project folder and HTML file. And the last 10% will probably be sacrificed to trying to figure out why Atom isn't working, or why your HTML file isn't doing what you want it to do <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Enter the citation data here, and it will appear as a pop-over!">(Francis 2022)</a>. <!-- This is how you will create a pop-over link for intext citations--></p>
          <br><!--this creates a break, Which is great for creating space in a variety of situations. Note that this is the only way to add a line break into your HTML. Adding a blank line will not translate to more spacing. -->
          <p> There are many useful things that you can do in HTML, and here we will provide a list of some things that may be useful for creating your site:</p>
            <ul> <!-- This creates an "unorderd list", or basically bullet points. Use <ol> if you want an "ordered", or numbered list (and don't forget to close it!). -->
              <li>You can also create regular links to things without pop-over content. For example, <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki">this link</a> goes to the Indian Country Wiki. You may also make links open up in a new tab by adding the target attribute with the the blank value: <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki" target="blank">same link, but it opens in a new tab</a></li> <!-- Just replace the href url with your desired url, and the normal text("this link") for your link -->
              <li>You may also create <a href="#jump">links that jump to other parts of the page</a> by putting an id in the element you want to jump to (see the <u>Image Sources</u> heading below to see where to put the id), and then doing #id in the href.<!-- Each id must be unique to jump to it --></li>
              <li>You may also format your text in an number of ways, including by: <b>bolding</b>, <i>italicizing</i>, <em>emphaszing</em>, <u>underlining</u> or by designating <strong>strong text</strong></li>
            </ul>
          <p> For ideas on what else is possible with HTML, you can check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a>, or ask your graduate assistant for some feedback on what you want to do with your essay.</p>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmI2kQy2Xh8?start=60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
